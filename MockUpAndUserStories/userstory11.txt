As a user, the student must be able to view the information of the course team.

When the student clicks on the "Course Team" navigation button, the student should be able to view the profile of each Teaching Assistant and the Instructor. 

When the student hovers over one of the profiles, the profile will be flipped and it will show the TA/Instructor's Office Hours, Location, and Contact Information.
