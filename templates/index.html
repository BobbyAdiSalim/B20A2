          <p>
            Databases are incredibly ubiquitous and underlie technology used by most people every day.
            Databases reside behind a huge fraction of websites. Most of the amenities we enjoy on the Web
            are provided by web database applications. Web-based email, forums and bulletin boards, online
            shopping, corporate web sites, and sports and news portals are all database-driven. To build a
            modern web site, you need to develop a database application. In this course, you will learn how to
            bring together Web and databases to build applications.
